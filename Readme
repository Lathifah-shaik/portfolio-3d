🧠 Key Components
Component	Description
#header	Hero section with name, role, and 3D background
.name	Custom-styled name with dynamic color on initial letter
#about	Skills and bio in two-column responsive layout
#projects	Grid-based project gallery with animated overlays
#contact	Contact form with icons and social media links
<canvas>	DOM node where Three.js renders the 3D scene
three-canvas	Styled via CSS for proper scaling across devices

🧪 Troubleshooting
3D model not visible?
✅ Confirm camera.position.z is set
✅ Ensure lighting (DirectionalLight, AmbientLight) is added
✅ Check the model path and file type (.glb/.gltf/.obj)

Canvas not resizing?
Use window.addEventListener('resize', ...) to auto-adjust renderer size.

📱 Responsive Design
Media queries optimize the layout for devices up to 768px. Mobile-specific tweaks include:

Hamburger navigation menu with toggle icon

Reduced font sizes and header image

3D section height capped (60vh) to prevent scroll bloat
